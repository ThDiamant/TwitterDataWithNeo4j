# TwitterDataWithNeo4j
Exploring Twitter data with Neo4j through python.

The data were extracted from the Twitter API, saved into a local MongoDB instance and then extracted as a json file. This json file is used as the input for the `TwitterDataWithNeo4j.ipynb` notebook in which we clean the data, create Neo4j graphs as well as query them to gain insights from the data.

A Medium article has also been written that explains all our work in more detail, see [here](https://medium.com/@thdiamant/exploring-twitter-data-with-neo4j-and-python-f97ab427db56).
